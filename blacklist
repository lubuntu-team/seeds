# Ubuntu has added a suggested package which installs a config file for network manager.
# This config file enables a feature which checks the connection is actually connected
# to the internet. It does this by connecting to a website on the internet every five
# minutes. Due to privacy concerns, Lubuntu is NOT installing this package by default,
# leaving it to the user to decide if he/she wants this feature.
